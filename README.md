# Ai_ML_AutomaticSpamReviewDetection

The spam reviews (i.e. Fake reviews provided by spammers to promote or demote
particular product) is the type to be covered in this research. Spam reviews are classified
by Jindal et. al. into mainly three types:
1- Type 1 Fake Reviews
2- Type 2 On Brands Reviews
3- Type 3 Non-Related Reviews

In this project we used the Yelp dataset to build a machine learning model which detect the spam 
reviewes based mainly on the review content.
